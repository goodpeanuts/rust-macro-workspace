# Rust Macro Workspace

This repository serves as a scaffold for quickly writing and testing Rust macros. It provides a structured workspace with the following components:

- **knowledge_ai**: A mock dependency used for testing and demonstrating macro functionality.
- **macroe**: A library containing procedural macros for Rust.
- **playground**: A sample application to validate and experiment with the macros.

## Features

- Pre-configured workspace for Rust macro development.
- Example procedural macro implementation.
- Mock dependencies for testing macro behavior.
- Easy-to-use playground for rapid iteration and debugging.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd rust-macro-workspace
   ```

2. Build the workspace:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. Test the macros in the `playground` project:
   ```bash
   cargo run playground
   ```

4. Modify the `macroe` crate to add or update macros, and use the `playground` project and command `cargo expand` in `playground` to validate them.

```bash
cargo expand
```
